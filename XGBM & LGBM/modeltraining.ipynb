    "\n",
    "In the **Titanic dataset** provided by Kaggle, the `titanic_test.csv` file only contains the feature columns (`X_test`) and lacks the target variable (`Survived`). The target variable is crucial for evaluating the performance of a classification model, as it allows us to compare the predicted values (`y_pred`) with the actual labels (`y_test`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the `titanic_test.csv` file does not have the target variable (`y_test`), **we cannot directly evaluate the model's accuracy or performance using this dataset**. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score require the true labels (`y_test`) to compute how well the model has performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Will We Use for Evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to evaluate the model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use the Titanic Train Dataset**: \n",
    "   - You will use the `titanic_train.csv` dataset to train the model. This dataset contains both features (`X_train`) and the target variable (`Survived`), which is used for training the model.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Split the Data**:\n",
    "   - If you do not have a separate validation set, you can split the `titanic_train.csv` dataset into a training set and a validation set (using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn).\n",
    "   - This split will give you both the feature data (`X_train`) and the target variable (`y_train`), as well as validation data (`X_val` and `y_val`), which allows for performance evaluation.\n",
