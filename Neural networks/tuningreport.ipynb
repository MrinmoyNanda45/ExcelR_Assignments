    "# **Random Search Cross-Validation for Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Random Search Cross-Validation (Random Search CV) is an efficient hyperparameter tuning technique that randomly samples different hyperparameter combinations and evaluates their performance using cross-validation. Unlike Grid Search, which evaluates all possible combinations exhaustively, Random Search provides a more computationally feasible approach by exploring a subset of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Methodology**\n",
    "In this study, Random Search CV was employed with the following setup:\n",

    "### Hyperparameter Distributions for Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "param_distributions = {\n",
    "    'hidden_layers': [(64,), (128,)],      # Possible values for hidden layers\n",
    "    'activation': ['relu'],                # Activation function choices\n",
    "    'learning_rate': [0.001],              # Learning rate values\n",
    "    'dropout_rate': [0.2],                 # Dropout rate options\n",

    "- **Hidden Layers:** The number of neurons in each hidden layer was selected from `(64,)` or `(128,)`.\n",

    "- **Learning Rate:** A fixed learning rate of `0.001` was used.\n",
    "- **Dropout Rate:** A dropout rate of `0.2` was applied to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "1. **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into three folds using K-Fold cross-validation.\n",
    "2. **Model Initialization:** A feedforward neural network was created with the sampled hyperparameters.\n",
    "3. **Training:** The model was trained on the training set while using `20%` of the training data for validation.\n",
    "4. **Early Stopping:** The training process was monitored using early stopping based on validation accuracy, with a patience of `2` epochs.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation:** The trained model was evaluated on the validation fold, and accuracy scores were recorded.\n",

    "# **Early Stopping Condition**\n",
    "An **early termination** criterion was defined to stop the search if a model achieved a validation accuracy **â‰¥ 98%**, avoiding unnecessary computations.\n",

    "# **Outcome**\n",
    "After completing `20` iterations of Random Search CV, the best hyperparameter combination was identified based on average cross-validation accuracy. This optimized configuration was then used to finalize the best-performing model.\n",

    "# **Conclusion**\n",
    "Random Search CV proved to be an efficient method for tuning hyperparameters while balancing computational cost and performance. By leveraging cross-validation and early stopping, the tuning process effectively identified an optimal model configuration while preventing overfitting."
