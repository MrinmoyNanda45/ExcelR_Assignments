    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis applies a Chi-Square test to investigate if there is a significant association between the type of device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and customer satisfaction levels at Mizzare Corporation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Mizzare Corporation collected customer satisfaction data across five levels (Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied, and Very Unsatisfied) for two types of smart home devices: **Smart Thermostats** and **Smart Lights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "The data is presented in a contingency table, showing the counts of customers in each satisfaction level for both device types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Satisfaction Level   | Smart Thermostat | Smart Light | Total |\n",
    "|----------------------|------------------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| Very Satisfied       | 50              | 70          | 120   |\n",
    "| Satisfied            | 80              | 100         | 180   |\n",
    "| Neutral              | 60              | 90          | 150   |\n",
    "| Unsatisfied          | 30              | 50          | 80    |\n",
    "| Very Unsatisfied     | 20              | 50          | 70    |\n",

    "1. Formulate the Hypotheses.\n",
    "2. Compute the Chi-Square Statistic.\n",
    "3. Determine the Critical Value and the p-value.\n",

    "- **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: Calculated as $(r - 1) \\times (c - 1)$, where \\( r \\) and \\( c \\) are the number of rows and columns in the table, respectively.\n",

    "We conclude that there is **no statistically significant association** between the type of device purchased (Smart Thermostat or Smart Light) and the customer satisfaction levels. Therefore, customer satisfaction does not appear to be dependent on the device type in this dataset.\n"
